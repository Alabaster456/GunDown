GunDown
=======

This project is a (in-the-making) showdown game, where the player has to click on this button (in the game, of course) when a message displays to win. Precision is a must! 

Things to add:

1. Website (COMPLETE)

2. Images for characters (COMPLETE)

3. Programming (ALMOST COMPLETE)

Ideas and Questions:

1. How will the message display in the game (when the user is told to shoot)?
2. Should the game end right away after one duel?
3. When the player is about to play, should different enemies appear with different diffculties?
4. There should be a way to link this game to Facebook, Twitter and so on. 
5. After a duel is finished, the user should be asked if they want to quit or continue to battle. (GOOD ONE!)
