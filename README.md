GunDown
=======

This project is a (in-the-making) showdown game, where the player has to click on their character when a message displays to win. 


Things to add:
1. Create an actual website.
2. Get images for characters, guns, etc.

Ideas and Questions:
1. Should you make it two players?

2. Should there be other weapons to select from?

3. Should there be other designs for your character?

4. Should it be able to take the user's name?

5. Should you make in-comment hint messages appear?

6. Should the user be able to activate cheats?

7. Should there be a graphical background (using JQuery or etc)? 

8. Instead of clicking, should the user just punch in a key to activate the action?
